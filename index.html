            Visual Studio is widely regarded as one of the best integrated development environments (IDEs) available in
            the software industry. Its robust features and user-friendly interface make it a popular choice among
            developers. One of the key strengths of Visual Studio is its versatility, as it supports multiple
            programming languages, including C#, Python, and JavaScript, among others. This allows developers to work on
            a wide range of projects using a single IDE. Additionally, Visual Studio offers powerful debugging tools,
            code refactoring capabilities, and seamless integration with version control systems, making it an efficient
            tool for software development. Its extensive library of extensions further enhances its functionality and
            allows developers to customize their workflow to suit their specific needs. Overall, Visual Studio's
            comprehensive set of features and its commitment to providing an optimal development experience make it a
            top choice for developers worldwide(<----this is an ai written paragraph). <br><br>
                How to set it up is:
                <br><br>
                1.To make a empty folder and if you have premade code, put the premade code file in the folder.if you
                dont have a
                premade code file then you better listen to #3.
                <br>
                2.Go to Visual Studio and click open folder in file which is found on the top right corner.and now your
                in the place where you code and if you had premade code then it should be on the left side of your
                screen, like the index.html and style.css.
                <br>
                3.If you dont have a premade coding,you would first hover to your folder name like mine is called 82 so
                hover to 82 and a file with a plus will show along with other icons.you would have to click the first
                icon,the file with a plus.Now, your able to type but, to get html type in index.html and for css type,
                style.css.
        </p>

            Console is like a place to test out your coding before putting it on the screen,solve you questions you
            don't want visable etc. Its very useful for noting and finding errors too!It helps lots to hide thing user
            can't see and you can do your work now without it showing on the screen. How to use console.log is to first
            lets say you want to make the console say hi then you would do console.log("hi") or console.log("hello
            world"). and know yur done coding but, you dont know how to check your console. So, first go live,right
            click on your screen and on the last options there is inspect. Once your there a black/white mini screen
            pops up you would look to see all your coding, and this is the element. To get to console tho is look at the
            word element and on the right will be console or a arrow.if its console click it and your done but i its
            arrow then click arow and one of the options are console and you would click the console.
